# Tony's Research project

## Phases

1. Determine project
2. Learn about how to build project
3. Building the project
4. Running the project to get results
5. Write up
6. Present *06/01/2021*

__ELI5__ - Explain like I'm 5...

## Determine project

### Alternatives

* Quantum
  * Quantum key distribution
    * ELI5 description is a prerequisite
    * quantum source emulator
    * photon communication channel emulator
    * Key distribution code

  * Measuring eaves-dropping in QKD and account for interference

* Machine learning
  * post quantum crypto algorithms
    * 50+ results
    * quantifying/**codifying** the algorithm for the result.
    * test data set?
    * who could validate results?

  * identifying quantum errors
    * need a bunch signals that describe "quantum results" with known "has error / doesn't have error" results

  * for a computational problem determine if quantum computer solution possible, and best type
    * Proof that algorthims can't be analyzed... *Chuck to research*

  * learning with errors (LWE)
  * Social Engineering
  * Stock Values

### Constraints

* Time
  * Weeks: 43 from 7/30/20 is 5/28/21
  * Hours: 860 assuming 20 hours/week
* Money
  * $1,000 or $2,000?? *Tony to research*
